# N2ME

n2me is a personal logging tool for quick annotations that can be reviewed later using AI.
It's fully open source, 100% privacy focused personal tool.



### Purpose
Opportunity on using LLM to retrieve meaningful information from a mass of personal logs.


### How it works
You add quick notes, which are just text.
You pre assign a category to a better organization.
You can use voice or text input, depending on your preference.


### Settings
You need to set your language (for the speech synthesis) and the LLM settings for the AI review.


### Privacy
The webapp runs fully on your device, no data is sent to the cloud.
It uses PGLite to store data locally.



### Importing data
If you want to import pre-existing data into n2me, you can do using a specific CSV import function.
The CSV file need to have a column "content" with the text, the "date"and an optional column "category_id" (in this case the category need to exist in n2me).
